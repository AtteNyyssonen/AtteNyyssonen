- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m  Atte NyyssÃ¶nen, currently studying my first year of automation engineering at the University of Tampere.

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in basically anything that has to do with either computers or technology. Currently just learning everything about coding.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything that has to do with coding at the same time as completing my uni studies. I already know the basics of Python so currently I'm trying to grasp
the basics of git CD/CI and front-end development with HTML and React. Also trying to constantly learn new things and better my Python skill set.

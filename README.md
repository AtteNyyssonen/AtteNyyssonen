- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m  Atte NyyssÃ¶nen, currently studying my first year of automation engineering at the University of Tampere.

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in basically anything that has to do with either computers or technology. Currently just learning everything about coding.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything that has to do with coding at the same time as completing my university studies. I already know Python and the basics of C++ so currently I'm trying to grasp a better understanding of C++ and different CD/CI frameworks.
